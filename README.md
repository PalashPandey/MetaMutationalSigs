# MetaMutationalSigs
![Logo](flask_ui_app/static/cover_photo.png) <br>

Mutational signature analysis is very active and important area of interest. There are several packages available now for mutational signature analysis and they all use different approaches and give nontrivially different results. Because of the differences in their results, it is important for researchers to survey the available tools and make choose the one that best suits their application. There is a need for software that can aggregate the results from different packages and present them in a user friendly way so as to facilitate effective comparison. 

We created this package *MetaMutationalSigs* to facilitate comprehensive mutational signature analysis by creating a wrapper for different packages and providing a standard format for their outputs so that they can be effectively compared. We have also standardized the input formats accepted by various packages so ease interoperability. We also create standard visualizations for the results of all packages to ensure easy analysis. Our software is easy to install and use through Docker ,a package manager that automates the dependencies. 


## Install Using Docker

docker pull pp535/metamutationalsigs

https://hub.docker.com/r/pp535/metamutationalsigs 

### Input: 
VCF files.

To run *metamutationalsigs* without using *sigflow* and *sigfit* on the data from your VCF file directory `C:\Users\...full_path...\docker_input_test`.  Just replace ``C:\Users\...full_path...\docker_input_test/`` with absolute path to your input directory that has VCF files. The results will be in a zipped file in your input directory.<br> 
``docker run --rm -it -v C:\Users\...full_path...\docker_input_test/:/app/input_vcf_dir test  --i "input_vcf_dir" --sigflow --sigfit``


We have browser UI available as well: <br>

``docker run --rm -it -p 5001:5001 -v C:\Users\...full_path...\docker_input_test/:/app/input_vcf_dir test  --browser``

Just replace ``C:\Users\...full_path...\docker_input_test/`` with absolute path to your input directory that has VCF files. Then go to your browser at http://localhost:5001/ for the browser user interface.

Once you select your *VCF file directory and the tools that you would like to run*, you will see a progress bar and when the progress bar reaches 100%, you can download the results as a zip file using the download results button. <br>

## Output: 

The output is returned as a compressed directory called `MetaMutationalResults`. Once uncompressed, this looks below. Directory `MetaMutationalResults` has the relevant results.

Inside `MetaMutationalResults`, we can find a folder for each tool that was selected.
